2024 felt weird, man. Summarizing a year like last year seems disjointed and messy. I've tried to write this post several times, but nothing is quite sticking. Instead of trying to trudge through and write the post I was hoping to write, I'm focusing on why reflecting is important to me. 

- I want to be able to look back and take note of my personal growth, my evolution.
- I want to be conscious of negativity bias and make an effort to remember the positive moments.
- I want to use the lack of direction I felt in 2024 to set meaningful goals for 2025.

The transitions that happened in 2024 oscilated between life-affirming and devestating. I often felt like I was existing in a liminal space of uncertainty. In all honesty, I lost sight of who I am in some ways. In other ways, I found paths that I had been searching for.

Here are some highlights by season:

- Winter was cold and snowy, which I do love. It was also lonely. I had moved into a small house in the woods nearly 30 minutes outside of my small town in fall of '23 after a breakup. The house was only accessible by a footbridge, nearly quarter mile walk from where I parked my car on the other side of the river. There were times I enjoyed the solitude, but the house was tiny and wasn't a good fit for us. During this time, I spent a lot of time reading and frankly, just trying to get by. I'm proud of my resilience, the way I navigated a difficult siutation, and I'm grateful for the stillness of the trees that surrounded my home during this season.

- Spring felt like a welcome transition - both with the warmer weather and with the activities I involved myself in. The area I live is often threatened by wildfire and proactive fire mitigation is part of life. I participated in a "prescribed burn" on the property I was living. These burns are low-intensity are adapted from [indigenous forest management practices](https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/03/14/how-indigenous-burning-shaped-the-klamaths-forests-for-a-millennia/) that occured before misguided fire-suppression policies were put in place. It was awesome. About 20 people from our little community, several people from outside of the region, and fire professionals came to burn about 3 acres of land.
